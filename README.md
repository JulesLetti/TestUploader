to get in running:
cd testuploader
rails s

-> testuploader in the name of the app file and rails s should get the server running. I can then see the page under localhost3000
-> Please not that is still not optimal (like no message that upload was successful etc) but it uploads everything to s3 and create a database with Email, Style, Video URL

That is the status so far. The cool thing is that the video can be process in any file type that we want and size etc could all be set.
